# Project: Caesar Cipher

# Goal

* Create a cipher that takes in a string and number(for shift factor) and then outputs a modified string

# Things to remember

* Don't forget to wrap `z` to `a`
* Don't forget to keep the same case (`lower` vs `upper`)

# Edge Cases

* Positive only shift or negative as well?
* built to handle `!`, should I build in more characters that don't need to be shifted?
